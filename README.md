# CITS2022-Trove-Project

This is an implementation of the 2022 Systems Programming Project 2 (CITS2002 @ UWA). To build the code go into the src folder and run

	$ make
	$ make clean

This will compile the program and produce a file called trove. The project specifications (which include how the progra is used and it's purpose) can also be found in this repo.

Note: I didn't implement the compressed file reader that is outlined int he project specs.
